Prompt to the agent:

Parse the word docs in the /docs folder and then analyse the parsed docs to generate Agile work items. 
If the work items contain requirements for PCF controls or plugins, scaffold the initial project structure.
Then start implementing the work items using the appropriate MCP servers.

If possible maintain a list of todo items and update the list as you progress through the work items. Ask input from me if you encounter any ambiguities or need clarifications.

Try to use the mcp servers wherever possible.
